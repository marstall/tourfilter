<br>---------- Forwarded message ----------<br>From: gill aharon<br>Date: Aug 13, 2006 1:54 PM<br>Subject: I need your help regarding my performance space, the Lily Pad<br><br>Hey all,<br><br>The Lily Pad has been forced to cancel all shows until further notice. (hopefully Monday morning we will get a reprieve. I am nervously hopeful.)<br><br>At the bottom of this email is the press release, a summary of the situation, and the address to which letters can be sent.<br><br>I believe that this is a result of my support for the Druid's application for a 2 am license which was vehemently opposed by my neighbor. The Druid was successful in their bid, largely due to the support of the neighborhood and because there were no complaints filed with the police. Since then we have received almost a complaint a night, including one night when nothing was happening ( i was playing ping pong). We, having had only one complaint in four years, are now getting them all the time. When the Zeitgeist lived in this space, we went through this because we had no license for live music, the result was a zoning change (in my name as the property owner) so that we were able to continue having performances as long as the cover was always a donation, i.e. we can't charge admission. As the Lily Pad, we have continued that policy and i checked with the zoning people before we opened as the Lily Pad, and again when we got our business license and was told we were fine. Apparently, the licensing people think we need a cabaret license (an old battle with the zeitgeist). The noise complaint issue has been a catalyst for the licensing board to take<br>action against us. I still believe that the city government is made of good folk, who enforce the rules as they perceive them, and believe that they believe their hand was forced in this situation.<br><br>I am hopeful that upon meeting with Elizabeth Lint, the executive officer who signed the "cease and desist" order, we will be able to demonstrate our value to the community, and our desire to work within the letter of the law, in order to continue to do what we do.<br><br>I am asking for your help in anticipation of a hearing regarding our ability to have performances here. We won the zoning boards approval, now we must win the licensing board's.<br><br>Your letters of support were the biggest factor in the approval of the zoning board, they will prove immeasurably valuable in overcoming this next hurdle.<br><br>If you are a musician, please speak to that. If you are one of my students, please talk about the recitals and how the performances are always all ages (like the pianofest). If you are a visual artist speak about that. Dance, film theater etc. If you have traveled here to perform or see a performance, let them know that the Lily Pad is a destination for those visiting the Boston area. The licensing board is about business, they want cambridge to be doing good business in a way that fits with the nature of the neighborhood. Inman Square is a growing vibrant business and artistic community, and this space (previously as the Zeitgeist and now as the Lily Pad) has and continues to contribute greatly to the vitality of the neighborhood.<br><br>Please forward this plea to anyone who might want to help.<br><br>Thank you very much for your support,<br><br>Gill Aharon<br><br>(617) 584-2218<br><br><br>IMPORTANT!!<br><br>the lily pad - boston's beloved forum for original, creative music - has been forced to <b>cancel all<br>shows until further notice</b>. due to noise complaints, the cambridge licensing board is obligated to follow the letter of the law in serving the lily pad with a 'cease and desist' order. the lily pad needs YOUR help urgently to survive. we need to show the city that the lily pad is a vital cultural center that serves a valuable function by providing a forum for creative musical expression. by showing our overwhelming support we can help overturn the order.<br><br>what you can do to help RIGHT NOW:<br><br>1. <b>write a letter of support for the lily pad</b>, stating that the venue is a vital asset that is necessary to the community, and that it does no harm. letters can be sent by mail to the following address:<br><br>Richard V. Scali, Chairman<br>Cambridge License Commission<br>831 Massachusetts Avenue<br>Cambridge, MA 02139-3068<br><br>or via email:<br><a href="mailto:license@ci.cambridge.ma.us">license@ci.cambridge.ma.us</a><br><br>2. <b>make a secure donation</b> to help offset our legal fees, either in person or by mail (internet donation opportunities coming soon):<br><br>the lily pad<br>1353 cambridge street<br>cambridge, ma 02138<br><br>again, we cannot stress enough that YOUR SUPPORT IS INTEGRAL TO THE SURVIVAL OF THE LILY PAD. if you support live music in cambridge, now is the time to show it.<br><br>------ End of Forwarded Message<br>
