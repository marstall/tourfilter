Hi!

You've been approved as a moderator on tourfilter.com. Now, when you see a show that:

1. is incorrect and should be deleted, you can delete it.
2. has the wrong date, you can correct the date and mail all the band's trackers with the new date.

How it works: You should start seeing a new 'admin only' section on the band pages (ex: http://www.tourfilter.com/dc/sparklehorse). Here, you can change the date inplace or click "invalidate" to remove the listing from the site altogether. Refresh the page to see the results of your change.

NOTE! If you change the date, ALL USERS TRACKING THAT BAND IN YOUR CITY WILL BE EMAILED IMMEDIATELY with the new date. So make sure to make sure. A comment by you will be automatically added to the show recording your date change, too. 

If you have any questions or ideas, email me at chris@tourfilter.com. 

THANKS!
