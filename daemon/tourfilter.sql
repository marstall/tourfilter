Monday, February 06, 2006 Stu Sherman: Kosovo Punk February 6th to February 20th Opening reception January 28th from 3-6pm Stu Sherman and several friends traveled to Kosovo from December 2004 to January 2005 on a mission both simple and complex, to figure out the musical landscape of the war-torn region. Due to the instability of the last fifteen years it is difficult to describe the state of Kosovo, which is currently under the governance and protection of the UN. While Sherman was researching, he found that the physical and psychological landscape of the region was horrifically altered from riots. During his brief stay there were constant rumors that the prime minister was going to be arrested and people would begin riots and murders anew. The people that Sherman talked to, who ranged from all over the spectrum of Kosovo society, gave him a fascinating glimpse into Kosovo music, culture, trends, and how you can create innovative art out of the rubble of your life. What resulted was only the first part of an ongoing study. This show uses the landscape of Kosovo to illustrate the punk culture â€“ a culture based on deconstructing norms and paternalistic repression. There are no photographs of concerts, kids with spiky hair, nihilistic teenagers, or the usual images conjured by something labeled â€œpunkâ€. Sherman presents the spaces inhabited by the creative individuals trying to build a new world out of the fragments of the old. The works are a personal dialogue with contemporary trends in art and their meaning both aesthetically and morally when confronted with actual destruction and tragedy. Stu Sherman is a professional iconoclast. After attending Wesleyan University as an undergraduate he moved to Boston to attend graduate school. His graduate education in law and public health was funded by an appearance on the television show Who Wants to be a Millionaire. He is self-taught as a photographer. His work will soon be exhibited on the American Apparel web page as part of the launch of an amateur photographers online gallery. Iris Alonzo, content advisor for American Apparel, described him as a â€œGhetto Gurskyâ€. He likes this description and hopes it sticks. This is his first solo show.

SALSA DANCING Always good dancing at our our Salsa night- it\'s a really great live band, and the dance teachers are two of the best in New England. Still plenty of space to dance, and it\'s just for fun! MONDAY, DEC. 19- STUMP! team trivia - come and pit your wits against the master! Prizes for winning teams. TUESDAY, DEC. 20- OLD TIME NIGHT Sandy Sheehan (\"Traditional Folk\" on WUMB) presents a night of holiday fun with lots of performers from the area playing fiddles, guitars, mandolins and of course, banjos (we might witness yet another of the dreaded banjo orchestra appearances if enough show up!). There will also be a special performance with the celebrated Kitchen Sync Cloggers, and many other guests. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 21- THE ANNUAL X-MAS CAVALCADE W/ CHANDLER TRAVIS More holiday fun with the Incredible Casuals\' Chandler Travis and his Philharmonic, with a big crew of guests and friends. Last year\'s festivities included Barrence Whitfield, Shaun Wortis, Jennifer Kimball and many others, and this year promises to bigger and better (call to get the latest update). \"Chandler Travis gets credit for finding such great musicians who love to play, for writing incredibly fun songs and for doing the choreography of who/when/what. Imagine a 1930s big band playing rock & roll, dixie, blues and everything in-between, being led by the crooner of all local crooners, Chandler himself.\" -Weekly Dig THURSDAY, DEC. 22- SOUL AMBITION The Soul Ambition Band is \"a horn driven blues jazz rock reggae funk fusion soul R&B experience \"(!) A big horn section drives the whole thing, and it\'s a beautiful thing to behold- needless to say, dancing will be a big part of the deal< FRIDAY , DEC. 23- ALTO REFORM SCHOOL / BRUCE MILLARD BAND Master sax player and composer Ken Field (Birdsongs of the Mesozoic, Willie Loco Alexander\'s Persistence of Memory Orchestra, and the Revolutionary Snake Ensemble) has yet another project, and this one\'s a winner. Named after the lockup where James Brown apparently spent part of his youth, it\'s a big band covering the essential funk of the mid 60\'s and 70\'s. Opener Bruce Millard has been a member of both the Jim Kweskin Band and the Howard Armstrong band, and now is fronting his own tight unit. SATURDAY , DEC. 24 - BRUNCH 9: - 2:30 pm Limited Menu until 4:000, Bar open until 7pm No Music Tonight TUESDAY, DEC. 27- PAUL RISHELL & ANNIE RAINES Always good to have this fine traditional blues duo back- they\'re arguably the best in this part of the country at illuminating the essential gutsy sound of down home guitar and harmonica, covering tunes from the Delta on up to Chicago with genuine authority. They\'ll bring members of their fine electric band in tonight for a set of hard driving classics to end the night. \"World class blues\"- Pulse WEDNESDAY , DEC. 28- RUST NEVER SLEEPS A startling retrospective of the music of Neil Young played by guitarist Ken Gibson and his band. \"From the traditional flannel shirts and flying hair to the facial expressions that convey great emotional torment , Gibson reenacts Young to near perfection\"- Hollis Brookline Journal THURSDAY, DEC. 29- SPLENDID NOBODIES / LINCOLN CONSPIRACY A double bill of two of the most interesting of the local bands to come along in the last few years. Splendid Nobodies are a rootsy unit who are fast gaining a following for their live shows- \"Maybe this band should reconsider its name. The Nobodies are quickly becoming Somebodies for their blues-meets-rockabilly sound. But the Splendid part justly describes their contagious and inspired playing.\" Boston Magazine. Lincoln Conspiracy is a very original pop rock band led by keyboardist Ethan Kreitzer- \"Insanely catchy piano-based pop\" - Boston Globe. FRIDAY, DEC. 30- TARBOX RAMBLERS A special night of traditional blues from one of the most compelling singers in the business- Michael Tarbox lays down a nice old timey blues groove and then proceeds to spice it up with contributions from his fine band- the end result is a delightfully funky and danceable melange that is based on the music of the 20\'s, 30\'s and 40\'s. \" His music, which blends gut-bucket blues with a sound that recalls X, The Blasters and \"Time Out of Mind\" Dylan, has a raw, urgent quality, thanks to Tarbox\'s rattling voice..\"- Wall Street Journal SATURDAY, DEC. 31- PRESSURE COOKER Reggae has in the last few years experienced a revival of sorts, spurred by a new generation\'s interest in Bob Marley and his Jamaican forbears, and at the leading edge is Pressure Cooker. Their solid and very much up to date interpretations of this tradition have to be heard (and felt!) to appreciate how seamlessly they mix the old and the new, and in their hands it all comes off as something quite original and fresh. \" These guys HEAR each other as much as they play, and the stuff\'s been allowed to simmer for EXACTLY the right amount of time. They deserve global hugeness, and I\'ll be pretty shocked if they don\'t get it.\"- The Noise. Call for dinner reservations early! No advance tickets, cover charge at the door. Bar open until 2am WEDNESDAY, .JAN. 4- SILENT DINER / BOATYARD RESIN This innovative young band from Virginia makes a fist time stop here to play some of their original and sometimes risky experimental improvisations on the familiar and unfamiliar. Known for their live shows, they really are a lot of fun. THURSDAY, .JAN. 5- BENEFIT FOR NEW ORLEANS MUSICIAN\'S CLINIC Things are far from mended in the Crescent City, and many musicians are still without homes and work. We host a night of music to raise money for one of the best organizations currently helping out. Call for details. FRIDAY , JAN. 6- ROCK BOTTOM The walls are still shaking from Rock Bottom\'s last visit this past summer, so we asked them back. Rock Bottom came about when a bunch of well known Boston rockers (from the Upper Crust, the Baggs, Ross Phasor and other bands) started playing their favorite \'70\'s covers, strictly for kicks. Fortunately they didn\'t know when to quit, and you\'ll never better renditions of guilty pleasure classics by Kansas, Billy Squire,Styx,Led Zeppelin, Free…and yes even the Darkness. SATURDAY, JAN. 7- LUTHER JOHNSON Luther continues to be one of the most respected and imitated of the generation of Chicago guitarists that came out of Muddy Waters\' influence (Luther played with Muddy for a number of years), and the sting of his sound is one of the most real and authentic there is. His venerable band is as nimble as ever, playing a combination of classics and his original tunes. \"Johnson is one of the leading exponents of Chicago blues…\" - Downbeat TUESDAY, .JAN. 10- LLOYD THAYER / BILL MCQUAID / MARK TOLSTRUP Lloyd has been a fixture on the streets of Cambridge for many years, honing his skills on the dobro and slide guitars, singing blues classics along with his own soulful material, and building a big following in the process. Bill released a nice CD last year with some eloquent covers of acoustic blues gems from the 30\'s and 40\'s, and he\'s constantly adding to his repertoire of little played classics.. WEDNESDAY, JAN. 11- SPOTTISWOODE & HIS ENEMIES (tentative) Two bands that work the fringes of the pop world with wildly original takes on music in general- Spottiswoode et al are a fascinating ensemble that is liable to come up with just about anything. \"A troubadour with a primitive yawp and a jones for performance art, Spottiswoode delivers libidinal punk rants and weirdo narratives like a horny, drug-addled Nick Cave. His Enemies, meanwhile, bang on found instuments and blow horns and suggest an oompah band on crack..\"- Village Voice. THURSDAY, JAN. 12- BUDDHA CLUB John Frazee and his funky new ensemble come together tonight to rock the place with a nice big horn section playing everything from classic funk to new pop flavored dance music. These folks can really get it down! FRIDAY./SATURDAY. JAN. 13/14- BEATLEJUICE The quintessential music of the Beatles played by the quintessential band, fronted by none other than Brad Delp (BOSTON) and composed of some of the best musicians on the Local scene, including members of the Fools and Juice in the machine. Really amazing! SOMERVILLE ARTISTS HOLIDAY BASH Wednesday, December 21, 4:30- 7:30pm Featuring unique artwork for sale by the following local artists : 1.

Ticket Information Thu 12/29/2005 ADDISON GROOVE PROJECT Special Guests Akashic Record Based in Boston, Addison Groove Project (AGP) has gained a reputation as one of the United Statesâ€™ hardest working and most talented young bands. With all of AGPâ€™s members under the age of 27, the group has already garnered a national following as well as appearances on some of the countryâ€™s most prestigious festivals, including Bonnaroo. AGP ranges from heavy funk to sophisticated jazz and all points in between. The band showcases their double saxophone attack (Dave Adams and Ben Groppe) on some songs, while Brendan McGinnâ€™s guitar work and vocals will be showcased on another. Rob Marscherâ€™s keyboard playing carries the band with complex left handed bass parts juxtaposed with melodic right handed chords and screaming solos. With Andrew Keith locking everything down on drums, these five players bring a big sound to the stage. Each member brings a different writing style to the table and that is apparent in the bandâ€™s diverse repertoire. More important than AGPâ€™s diversity (and the strength of each individual) is their ability to play as a whole.

Three years on, Cole and his dust-choked vocals and barbed-wire guitar are back in Boston, along with a new band and a new attitude that both figure prominently on his new album, Hypocriticool, a folk/rock/pop album that corrals 13 punchy, teary-eyed, mystic songs into one household. Combining the best elements of Norah Jones, Tori Amos, and Sarah McLachlan, Maria DeMaio proves herself quite the frontwoman. DeMaio fuses the artistic freedom of jazz, the power of soul, and the raw emotion of blues into a seamless blend that conjures up the top artists of the past 30 years. The award winning songwriter combines her soulful delivery with intensely personal writing steeped in intent and sincerity.

The sheer force of five trombones playing simultaneously was to be their calling card. New Orleans is well known for its excess. It should be no surprise that their musicians are prone to overindulge a bit. Still, when Mark Mullins and Craig Klein (Harry Connick Jr\'s Band) formed the trombone blitzkreig of Bonerama, skeptics and traditionalists raised their voices in puritanical protest. A funk band featuring five trombone players had never been done, even in the \'anything goes\' environs of New Orleans. Who did these guys think they were? Isn\'t one trombone loud enough? Mark Mullins and Craig Klein didn\'t think so. Maybe they suffered from years of being relegated to the back of the horn section, waiting for the day when they would raise their criminally undervalued slide horns to the sky and render obsolete the trumpets and saxophones. It seems that day has come. Ticket Price: $10 21 + General Admission BONERAMA Ticket Information Wed 1/18/2006 COLLEGE NIGHT â€“ YOUR COLLEGE ID GETS YOU IN FREE!

The bandâ€™s songs have appeared on a slough of hit television shows like â€œERâ€, â€œScrubsâ€, and â€œEverwoodâ€ - films suchs as, Mira Sorvinoâ€™s â€œToo Tired To Dieâ€, and tracks from The Odds Of Winning have already been licensed for new episodes of â€œThird Watchâ€, â€œERâ€, â€œSummerlandâ€, and â€œScrubsâ€. In fact Meadow Soprano has been seen wearing a Churchills t-shirt on â€œThe Sopranos.â€ The Odds Of Winning may be a bit darker in tone and emotion than some of their previous releases, but equally as infectious with their signature power pop gems like â€œSometimes Your Best Isnâ€™t Good Enough,â€ heard throughout. This new album retains all the melodic bombast and sparkling hooks of their past word, but adds a twist of bitter sadness. This depth of sad optimism set to riffs so catchy they would make all of Cheap Trick blush.

Call them psychedelic dirt-rock or a garage band with a soul. By any definition, Paranoid Social Club is an incredibly talented group of musicians who write brilliant songs that combine elements of funk, punk, soul, and ska. Paranoid Social Club\'s Dave Gutter and Jon Roods have been writing songs together since they were 12 years old. The two went on to form the now legendary Rustic Overtones. After building a large and loyal fan base by playing 150 incendiary live shows a year, the band was signed to Arista Records in 1998. Circumstance prevented the release of the band?s Arista album. Following the departure of label president Clive Davis, the band was granted a release from their Arista contract. With a handful of self-produced demos in hand, the group quickly negotiated a deal with Tommy Boy Records. In 2001, Tommy Boy released the Viva Nueva album to critical acclaim and moderate sales success. But that\'s in the past... The Future is Now!

Founded over five years ago, the Steep Canyon Rangers formed when Woody Platt (Guitar), Mike Guggino (Mandolin), Graham Sharp (Banjo) and Charles Humphrey III (Bass) joined musical forces at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. While coming from varied musical backgrounds, the friends shared a deep interest in Bluegrass and a fascination with the sounds of the genreâ€™s golden era. From the beginning, the Steep Canyon Rangers forged a unique synergy of new and traditional sounds, drawing on influences such as Earl Scruggs, Bill Monroe, Larry Sparks and others. With the recent addition of California recruit Nicky Sanders (Fiddle), the Rangers are churning out fresh, traditional bluegrass compostions and are quickly becoming one of the premier young bands in the circuit today. HOT DAY AT THE ZOO - This progressively modern, 5-piece string band (guitar, mandolin, dobro, banjo, upright bass) is pioneering a new genre of music their fans are calling \"ZooGrass\"!!! It\'s a high-energy, gritty-urban-bluegrass with strong elements of folk, blues, ragtime and jazz thrown in for good measure.
