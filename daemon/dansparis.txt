!synopsis!: <i>Dans Paris</i> (Inside Paris) by Christophe Honor&eacute; (France, 2006, 93 min.). &#8220;Starring two of the most exciting young actors in European cinema, Romain Duris and Louis Garrel, the deftly executed <i>Dans Paris</i> is simultaneously a love letter to the titular city, an affectionate homage to the French New Wave, and a moving study of a middle-class family haunted by the suicide of a teenage daughter&#8221; (BBCi Films). When Paul&#8217;s (Romain Duris) relationship with girlfriend Anna (Joana Preiss) comes apart, he heads for the apartment shared by his brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel) and their divorced father Mirko (Guy Marchand). Retreating into his brother&#8217;s room, Paul refuses to get out of bed, despite the entreaties of his family. <i>Dans Paris</i> is &#8220;a genuinely honest, unpretentious, and delightful small film, alternately sober and effervescent&#8221; (<i>Variety</i>). In French with English subtitles.

!synopsis!: <i>Alice Neel</i> by Andrew Neel (2007, 72 min.). Portrait painter Alice Neel (1900&#8211;1984) was a self-described collector of souls who, through six decades of the twentieth century, recorded her sitters on canvas, among them Andy Warhol, Bella Abzug, Allen Ginsberg, and Annie Sprinkle. Neel always sought the "authentic" and sacrificed almost everything for her art, delving so far into the psyches of her sitters she would nearly lose herself. Yet Neel was also a dedicated mother, raising two sons in the bohemian world she inhabited. Filmmaker Andrew Neel, Alice Neel&#8217;s grandson, puts together the pieces of the painter's life using intimate one-on-one interviews with Neel&#8217;s surviving family and personal archival video. The result is a tumultuous biography and the legacy of Alice Neel&#8217;s determination to paint her era. Steven Cooper, PhD  of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute will lead a discussion following  the screening.

!synopsis!: <i>Lights in the Dusk</i> (Laitakaupungin valot) by Aki Kaurism&aring;ki (Finland, 2006, 78 min.). From writer/director Aki Kaurism&aring;ki, <i>Lights in the Dusk</i> concludes the trilogy began by <i>Drifting Clouds</i> and <i>The Man Without a Past</i>. Where the trilogy&#8217;s first film was about unemployment and the second about homelessness, the theme of the final installment is that of loneliness. Koistinen, a shy night watchman in Helsinki, lives alone in a modest apartment and dreams of a better life. Soon he meets Mirja, a femme fatale who, in cahoots with jewel thieves, sets him up as the fall guy in their latest heist, taking advantage of his trusting manner. Deeply poetic, <i>Lights in the Dusk</i> is &#8220;handsomely shot and composed like the work of a Scandinavian Edward Hopper&#8221; (Phillip French, <i>The Guardian</i>). In Finnish with English subtitles.

!synopsis!: <i>Shadow of the House</i> by Allie Humenuk (2007, 78 min.). Filmmaker Allie Humenuk spent more than 7 years following Cuban-born photographer Abelardo Morell to create this intimate and honest document of one of Boston&#8217;s most internationally recognized artists. (The first major exhibition of Morell&#8217;s enveloping camera obscura images, &#8220;Abelardo Morell: The Camera Eye,&#8221; took place at the MFA in 1999.) Candid glimpses and conversations allow the viewer to truly get to know this extraordinary man as an obsessed artist, husband, and father. Humenuk gains the photographer&#8217;s complete trust during her long and often one-on-one shoots, which becomes evident in this unrestrained and honest portrait.  The narrative skips across time and space from his early childhood escape from Castro&#8217;s regime to his status as a world - renowned photographer. The film explores his daily working life as an artist and his eventual return to Cuba after 40 years of living in exile. Shadow of the House uncovers the deep layers of a man who is pushed to confront his past and his familial allegiances as it explores his unique artistic vision.

When Paul&#8217;s (Romain Duris) relationship with girlfriend Anna (Joana Preiss) comes apart, he heads for the apartment shared by his brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel) and their divorced father Mirko (Guy Marchand).

Dans Paris
2006
Saturday, September 29, 2007
http://www.mfa.org/dynamic/events/image_1_29737.jpg
<i>Dans Paris</i> (Inside Paris) by Christophe Honor&eacute; (France, 2006, 93 min.). &#8220;Starring two of the most exciting young actors in European cinema, Romain Duris and Louis Garrel, the deftly executed <i>Dans Paris</i> is simultaneously a love letter to the titular city, an affectionate homage to the French New Wave, and a moving study of a middle-class family haunted by the suicide of a teenage daughter&#8221; (BBCi Films). When Paul&#8217;s (Romain Duris) relationship with girlfriend Anna (Joana Preiss) comes apart, he heads for the apartment shared by his brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel) and their divorced father Mirko (Guy Marchand). Retreating into his brother&#8217;s room, Paul refuses to get out of bed, despite the entreaties of his family. <i>Dans Paris</i> is &#8220;a genuinely honest, unpretentious, and delightful small film, alternately sober and effervescent&#8221; (<i>Variety</i>). In French with English subtitles.

!synopsis!: <i>Leila Khaled: Hijacker</i> by Lina Makboul (Sweden, 2005, 58 min.). In 1969, Palestinian Leila Khaled made history by becoming the first woman to hijack an airplane. As a Palestinian child growing up in Sweden, filmmaker Lina Makboul admired Khaled for her bold actions; as an adult, she began asking complex questions about the legacy created by her childhood hero. This fascinating documentary is at once a portrait of Khaled, an exploration of the filmmaker&#8217;s own understanding of her Palestinian identity, and a complex examination of the nebulous dichotomy between &#8220;terrorist&#8221; and &#8220;freedom fighter.&#8221;

!synopsis!: <i>Alice Neel</i> by Andrew Neel (2007, 72 min.). Portrait painter Alice Neel (1900&#8211;1984) was a self-described collector of souls who, through six decades of the twentieth century, recorded her sitters on canvas, among them Andy Warhol, Bella Abzug, Allen Ginsberg, and Annie Sprinkle. Neel always sought the "authentic" and sacrificed almost everything for her art, delving so far into the psyches of her sitters she would nearly lose herself. Yet Neel was also a dedicated mother, raising two sons in the bohemian world she inhabited. Filmmaker Andrew Neel, Alice Neel&#8217;s grandson, puts together the pieces of the painter's life using intimate one-on-one interviews with Neel&#8217;s surviving family and personal archival video. The result is a tumultuous biography and the legacy of Alice Neel&#8217;s determination to paint her era. Director present August 29.

!synopsis!: <i>Shadow of the House</i> by Allie Humenuk (2007, 78 min.). Filmmaker Allie Humenuk spent more than 7 years following Cuban-born photographer Abelardo Morell to create this intimate and honest document of one of Boston&#8217;s most internationally recognized artists. (The first major exhibition of Morell&#8217;s enveloping camera obscura images, &#8220;Abelardo Morell: The Camera Eye,&#8221; took place at the MFA in 1999.) Candid glimpses and conversations allow the viewer to truly get to know this extraordinary man as an obsessed artist, husband, and father. Humenuk gains the photographer&#8217;s complete trust during her long and often one-on-one shoots, which becomes evident in this unrestrained and honest portrait.  The narrative skips across time and space from his early childhood escape from Castro&#8217;s regime to his status as a world - renowned photographer. The film explores his daily working life as an artist and his eventual return to Cuba after 40 years of living in exile. Shadow of the House uncovers the deep layers of a man who is pushed to confront his past and his familial allegiances as it explores his unique artistic vision.

synopsis: <i>Alice Neel</i> by Andrew Neel (2007, 72 min.). Portrait painter Alice Neel (1900&#8211;1984) was a self-described collector of souls who, through six decades of the twentieth century, recorded her sitters on canvas, among them Andy Warhol, Bella Abzug, Allen Ginsberg, and Annie Sprinkle. Neel always sought the "authentic" and sacrificed almost everything for her art, delving so far into the psyches of her sitters she would nearly lose herself. Yet Neel was also a dedicated mother, raising two sons in the bohemian world she inhabited.

!synopsis!: <i>Dans Paris</i> (Inside Paris) by Christophe Honor&eacute; (France, 2006, 93 min.). &#8220;Starring two of the most exciting young actors in European cinema, Romain Duris and Louis Garrel, the deftly executed <i>Dans Paris</i> is simultaneously a love letter to the titular city, an affectionate homage to the French New Wave, and a moving study of a middle-class family haunted by the suicide of a teenage daughter&#8221; (BBCi Films). When Paul&#8217;s (Romain Duris) relationship with girlfriend Anna (Joana Preiss) comes apart, he heads for the apartment shared by his brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel) and their divorced father Mirko (Guy Marchand). Retreating into his brother&#8217;s room, Paul refuses to get out of bed, despite the entreaties of his family. <i>Dans Paris</i> is &#8220;a genuinely honest, unpretentious, and delightful small film, alternately sober and effervescent&#8221; (<i>Variety</i>). In French with English subtitles.

!synopsis!: <i>Alice Neel</i> by Andrew Neel (2007, 72 min.). Portrait painter Alice Neel (1900&#8211;1984) was a self-described collector of souls who, through six decades of the twentieth century, recorded her sitters on canvas, among them Andy Warhol, Bella Abzug, Allen Ginsberg, and Annie Sprinkle. Neel always sought the "authentic" and sacrificed almost everything for her art, delving so far into the psyches of her sitters she would nearly lose herself.

<i>Alice Neel</i> by Andrew Neel (2007, 72 min.). Portrait painter Alice Neel (1900&#8211;1984) was a self-described collector of souls who, through six decades of the twentieth century, recorded her sitters on canvas, among them Andy Warhol, Bella Abzug, Allen Ginsberg, and Annie Sprinkle. Neel always sought the "authentic" and sacrificed almost everything for her art, delving so far into the psyches of her sitters she would nearly lose herself.
