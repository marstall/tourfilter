national search/feed
- daemon that gets all RSS or ICAL feeds, puts them into a database table with a city code field
- url scheme: 
	www.tourfilter.com/search/regina+spektor
	www.tourfilter.com/search/regina+spektor.xml
	
nightly fetch x num of cities

index: simple sql like query, perhaps with special agnosticisms for band name syntax (the, &, punctuation, etc.)

bonus: free text search backing it up, may as well make that part of the initial index pull (meaning take it direct from the db?)

amy: i feel guilty, i led her on. i hate this aspect of dating.
