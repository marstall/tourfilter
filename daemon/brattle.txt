title: Triad Election
synopsis: This sensational pair of gangster films are the latest stateside releases from one of the current masters of Hong Kong cinema. Johnnie To has churned out some of the most consistently entertaining films coming from Hong Kong in the past 10 years and yet his films aren&#146;t the usual empty action extravaganzas. Though his style is reminiscent of Martin Scorsese &#150; gritty and streetwise yet breathtakingly choreographed &#150; the ELECTION films bear a more than passing resemblance to Coppola&#146;s Godfather Trilogy. As with Coppola&#146;s films these films constitute a gangster epic &#150; except the &#145;family&#146; in To&#146;s films is not brought together by blood but rather by the bonds of friendship and loyalty. There&#146;s the same harkening back to tradition and ritual and the same struggle with changing times that the Corleones face but modernity is represented here not by the emergence of the drug trade but by shady real estate dealings on mainland China. Both films follow the recent history of Wo Sing, Hong Kong&#146;s oldest Triad Society through one of their oldest rituals &#150; the election of a new chairman. ELECTION tells the story of the rise to power of Lok (Yam) and his struggle with the impetuous Big D (Leung Ka-fai). With an almost anthropological attention to detail, To reels us in and then unleashes a wave of tense action. In TRIAD ELECTION, the time has come to appoint a new chairman and Lok&#146;s prot&#233;g&#233;e Jimmy (Koo) is the prime candidate &#150; except his only desire is to go straight. When push comes to shove, though, he proves that he can be just as ruthless as his predecessor. Overly political, witty, deep, and thrilling, ELECTION and TRIAD ELECTION are certainly not to be missed. &#147;One of the greatest action directors working in the world and one of the most excitingly prolific&#133; To has built a dazzling brilliant career out of cinematic mayhem: here he rises to the challenge of that legacy with a metaphor about capitalism, men and meat that is perfect in its simplicity and barbarism.&#148; &#150; Manohla Dargis, The New York Times&#147;Johnnie To has reinvented the gangster genre for the 21st century.&#148; &#150; Film Forum, NYC

title: Walk on the Wild Side
synopsis: Stanwyck is in a supporting role in this sexy &#145;60s melodrama but oh what a role! She plays the madam of a &#145;30s bordello in New Orleans and presides over a group of women including Jane Fonda. Things get a little rocky when a lovelorn man (Harvey) shows up trying to reunite with his long lost girl, Hallie (Capucine). The credit sequence, by the way, with Saul Bass&#146;s strutting cat and Elmer Bernstein&#146;s strutting jazz is sensational.

Castle, the marketing mastermind who brought cinema such treats as The Tingler and 13 Ghosts, plays it fairly straight, creating a Hitchcockian psychological thriller with a campy sense of humor. &#150; BAM Cinematek Not available on DVD.

title: Clueless
synopsis: Think the Brattle&#146;s too good to show CLUELESS? &#133; As if! It is, hands down, one of our favorite literary adaptations &#150; and teen movies for that matter. Director/writer Amy Heckerling transposes Jane Austen&#146;s classic novel Emma to Beverly Hills, keeping all of its charm, wit and passion while making it appealing to a whole new generation. Popular girl Cher (Silverstone) is the queen of her school and spends her time doing &#145;good deeds&#146; like making-over the new girl, Tai (Murphy), and playing matchmaker for her unhappy teachers. But when Tai acts as a none-too-flattering mirror for the shallow and materialistic teen, Cher finally finds that there&#146;s more to life than just shopping and being popular. Silverstone embodies the impossibly perky Cher so well that her performance alone is worth the price of admission.

title: Persuasion
synopsis: As much as I love the BBC Pride &amp; Prejudice miniseries with Colin Firth (be still my heart), this small, quiet film of Jane Austen's last novel is, by far, my favorite adaptation. Amanda Root is the perfect Anne Elliot &#150; meek and overlooked at the start, she grows steadily stronger and more luminous throughout the film. Everyone knows an Austen tale will end happily, but there&#146;s joy in feeling again and again that you&#146;re not quite sure it&#146;ll turn out the way you want. Will Anne Elliot recapture the love of Captain Wentworth? Will Louisa&#146;s youth and beauty steal his heart? Will Anne&#146;s family ever appreciate her? Will the Captain come to the card party?! I know all the answers, yet, without fail, I get goosebumps at the climatic point, in both the novel and the film. &#150; Amanda D., Harvard Book Store

title: A Scanner Darkly
synopsis: After mastering episodic comedy, raucous nostalgia trips and realtime digital video experiments, Richard Linklater has recently turned his attentions to animation. His ear for stoner-philosopher speak and affinity for Austin misfits make A SCANNER DARKLY a return to form for the director. Linklater's rotoscoping technique lends an extra level of paranoia and disassociation to Philip K. Dick's classic story of a covert drug enforcement agent whose identity is kept a secret even from his superiors. Things get really weird when he is assigned to investigate himself. A SCANNER DARKLY works as a thoughtful, elegiac statement on drug abuse, a vicious satire on the war on drugs, and as a testament to animation's endless potential for storytelling.

synopsis: Chaplin&#146;s first synch-sound film was, and remains, his most controversial. It was the first time he had ever written a script in advance, and he shot on a closed set. Chaplin stars in a dual role as a Jewish barber and the dictator Adenoid Hynkel who he is mistaken for. After the reality of Germany under Hitler had been fully exposed, Chaplin wished that he had never made THE GREAT DICTATOR. Yet, almost 70 years later, the film represents a unique attempt to laugh in the face of horror, to remain on the side of civilization when barbarity reigned. &#150; adapted from notes for Film Society of Lincoln Center

Chaplin&#146;s full balletic and comedic powers are brought to bear on showing the lengths that he goes to to maintain the illusion and keep the attention of the girl. A wonderful treat in any condition but we are ecstatic to be able to present it in a brand new 35mm print!

title: Metropolis
synopsis: Certainly one of Kino&#146;s greatest achievements of the past 10 years has been bringing this fantastic resurrection of one of cinema&#146;s masterpieces to the U.S. Amid the gleaming towers of a gigantic city of the future the pampered son of the big boss himself is smitten by a young woman and follows her into the depths of the city &#150; where he discovers what really makes Metropolis run. As slavishly regimented workers with numbers instead of names toil amid smoke-belching machinery, he has a vision of slaves lining up for sacrifice. Meanwhile, his father anticipates unrest and makes plans to defuse it, inciting an eccentric inventor to fashion an agent provocateur, the &#145;robot-Maria&#148; &#150; one of the most indelible icons of science fiction film.

title: Hannah Takes The Stairs
synopsis: The much-touted new wave of independent filmmaking continues with this outstanding, intimate romantic comedy. The alluring Greta Gerwig stars as the precocious Hannah, a fresh college graduate who falls for one, and then the other, of a pair of friends at a Chicago company where she is interning. HANNAH sports all of the hallmarks of the so-called &#147;Mumblecore&#148; movement: wry dialogue, improvised performances, a frank depiction of modern relationships and a wistful realism. Something of a romantic shaggy-dog story HANNAH is episodic, rambling and funny as it follows Hannah on her quest to end her &#145;chronic dissatisfaction&#146; and find a boyfriend worthy of her.

Part of Bergman's unofficial film trilogy, THE SILENCE explores some of the filmmaker's greatest concerns such as emotional and physical alienation, the intricacies of family relations, and sensuality. Tragic and beautifully filmed, THE SILENCE is a film experience not easily forgotten.

title: Pierrot Le Fou
synopsis: After abandoning his wife at a Parisian party, bored Ferdinand (Belmondo) flees his bourgeois existence with his babysitter and ex-lover, Marianne (Karina). Taking it on the lam to the south of France, the couple becomes an existential Bonnie and Clyde, battling gunrunners, gas station attendants, and American tourists as they come face to face with their own roles as characters in a pop-cultural landscape. A profound turning point in Godard&#146;s cinema, Pierrot le fou recalls the gangster cool of Breathless and Band of Outsiders while also pointing towards the increasingly essayistic, apocalyptic visions of Two or Three Things I Know About Her and Weekend. &#147;Whimsical and melancholic, playful and heavy as a heart swollen with emotion.&#146;&#148; &#150; Manohla Dargis, The New York Times&#147;Made in the middle of Godard's greatest period, it's a grand summation of everything he'd achieved since Breathless &#150; collage structure, autonomous sound, interpolated set pieces &#150; as well as his version of a location thriller. Shot in wide-screen and saturated primary colors, mainly in the south of France, Pierrot looks sensational&#133; The movie itself radiates joy of cinema.&#148; - J. Hoberman, The Village Voice

title: Hannah Takes The Stairs
synopsis: The much-touted new wave of independent filmmaking continues with this outstanding, intimate romantic comedy. The alluring Greta Gerwig stars as the precocious Hannah, a fresh college graduate who falls for one, and then the other, of a pair of friends at a Chicago company where she is interning. HANNAH sports all of the hallmarks of the so-called &#147;Mumblecore&#148; movement: wry dialogue, improvised performances, a frank depiction of modern relationships and a wistful realism. Something of a romantic shaggy-dog story HANNAH is episodic, rambling and funny as it follows Hannah on her quest to end her &#145;chronic dissatisfaction&#146; and find a boyfriend worthy of her.

synopsis: After abandoning his wife at a Parisian party, bored Ferdinand (Belmondo) flees his bourgeois existence with his babysitter and ex-lover, Marianne (Karina). Taking it on the lam to the south of France, the couple becomes an existential Bonnie and Clyde, battling gunrunners, gas station attendants, and American tourists as they come face to face with their own roles as characters in a pop-cultural landscape. A profound turning point in Godard&#146;s cinema, Pierrot le fou recalls the gangster cool of Breathless and Band of Outsiders while also pointing towards the increasingly essayistic, apocalyptic visions of Two or Three Things I Know About Her and Weekend. &#147;Whimsical and melancholic, playful and heavy as a heart swollen with emotion.&#146;&#148; &#150; Manohla Dargis, The New York Times&#147;Made in the middle of Godard's greatest period, it's a grand summation of everything he'd achieved since Breathless &#150; collage structure, autonomous sound, interpolated set pieces &#150; as well as his version of a location thriller. Shot in wide-screen and saturated primary colors, mainly in the south of France, Pierrot looks sensational&#133; The movie itself radiates joy of cinema.&#148; - J. Hoberman, The Village Voice

synopsis: Fifty years into the future our earth is frozen and the sun is slowly dying. The earth's last hope, a crew of eight, has been sent on the ominously named Icarus II to reignite the sun. The second crew to attempt this mission, they are haunted by the unknown fates of their predecessors. As they approach their destination they are both awestruck and terrified by the gravity of their mission and the utter brilliance of the sun. Director Danny Boyle has reinvented space travel just as he reinvigorated the zombie film with his hit 28 DAYS LATER. Completely embracing the exquisite abyss that has enthralled science-fiction fans for years he also manages to do something completely new. Boyle brings a fresh, self-aware perspective to the genre that is undeniably exciting.

When the DC-mini falls into the wrong hands, it's up to a prim psychotherapist and her sprightly alter-ego, the titular PAPRIKA, to find the culprit before the dream-state and reality irrevocably collide! Satoshi Kon's films are smart and challenging and PAPRIKA's artistry and unexpectedly sweet emotional payoff make it one of the most delightful films of 2007.

title: Grindhouse
synopsis: When GRINDHOUSE failed to meet box office expectations upon its release this spring, it was dismissed as an overlong snooze from two self-indulgent filmmakers. It also happens to be one of our favorite films of the year. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino&#146;s big-budget homage to exploitation cinema is a gross, sleazy, smart and hilarious tribute to going to the movies for the sheer fun of it. Rodriguez&#146;s PLANET TERROR casts Rose MacGowan as a plucky go-go dancer who must save the world from a zombie apocalypse. In DEATH PROOF, Tarantino gives Kurt Russell his best role in years as a psycho bent on offing a band of girlfriends with his souped-up Dodge Charger. Both feature-length movies (Tarantino&#146;s in particular) have a smart and fresh take on the genre, and there&#146;s even trailers for phoney upcoming films like Eli Roth&#146;s holiday slasher Thanksgiving (&#147;White meat! Dark meat! All will be carved!&#148;) and Rob Zombie&#146;s Werewolf Women Of The S.S. Explosively entertaining.

In fact, they don&#146;t believe that he even knows the meaning of friendship. Fran&#231;ois&#146; business partner, Catherine, wagers that he can&#146;t produce his best friend and challenges him to introduce them. Determined to win the bet, Fran&#231;ois enlists a friendly cabbie, Bruno, to pose as his friend and help him learn how to be a likeable person. This witty, erudite comedy is a wonderful film from one of France&#146;s leading filmmakers and one of its most beloved stars.

synopsis: An entirely unexpected office comedy from Danish director Lars von Trier, THE BOSS OF IT ALL marks von Trier's first Danish film since 1998's The Idiots. Ravn (Gantzler), the owner of an I.T. company, attributes all of his company's executive decisions to a fictional &#147;Boss Of It All.&#148; Conveniently the fictional boss lives in the United States and communicates solely via e-mail. However, when a potential buyer demands to meet the company's boss he must hire Kristoffer (Albinus), an out-of-work actor to masquerade as the loathed CEO. What follows is a hilarious comedy of errors as Kristoffer is confronted with the chaos and confusion of meeting the company's staff; all of whom have been given contrasting information about their fabled boss.

synopsis: George Ratliff&#146;s (Hell House) narrative feature debut suffered from a truncated run in Boston this summer, but this thriller is not just another creepy-little-kid movie, and deserves a second look. Joshua (Kogan) is an exceptionally gifted, albeit taciturn and morbid 9-year old who lives in an immaculate Manhattan apartment with his parents. Joshua&#146;s mother (Farmiga) slides into an increasingly bleak and violent despair when Joshua&#146;s newborn sister goes on an interminable crying jag. Is Farmiga suffering from a seriously bad case of post-partum depression &#150; or does it have more to do with her offbeat son&#146;s increasingly unusual behavior? Ratliff does a superb job establishing a menacing, off-kilter tone as the family implodes, and Farmiga delivers a fearless performance as a young mother in the throes of a total nervous breakdown, making JOSHUA an effective and disquieting examination of the fears of parenthood.

On the eve of the 16th anniversary of the Romanian Revolution, a pretentious, small-town TV host strains to produce a show to commemorate the event but the only people he can find to interview are an alcoholic history teacher and a lonely retiree, who moonlights as Santa. As these two struggle to defend their self-professed positions as vanguards of the revolution, the TV producer sees his show disintegrating before his eyes.

synopsis: A keenly perceptive, frankly sensual adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's classic novel about the turbulent love affair between an aristocratic woman and her husband&#146;s gamekeeper. It&#146;s 1921 and Constance Chatterley, a young bride frustrated by her marriage to a wheelchair-bound veteran, has moved to one of her husband&#146;s rural estates. Lonely and isolated in a rural environment that bores her, Lady Chatterley nonetheless finds her desire awakened by her taciturn gamekeeper Oliver Parkin. LADY CHATTERLEY tells the story of a passion that is both innocent and subversive &#150; one that transcends, without ever ignoring, class and social conventions. As Constance and Parkin nourish their mutual love, both enter into a radical realm where nature, sex and romance merge into one powerful experience. Winner of 5 Cesar Awards (the French 'Oscar'), including Best Picture and Best Director.

synopsis: This visceral and brutal thriller helped usher in a new wave of exciting horror films from Britain. A bike messenger named Jim (Murphy) wakes up in a London hospital and finds that a plague has rendered the city a wasteland. The only inhabitants left are a smattering of survivors and the hordes of vicious and infected victims of the mysterious virus. Shot on video for added realism, the film&#146;s first half is a terrifying new spin on the zombie genre, and when Jim and his friends finally make their way to a military outpost, 28 DAYS LATER becomes an arch commentary on the idea that hell is, in fact, other people. The sight of Murphy walking through an utterly deserted London remains one of the most memorable scenes from the last decade.

Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto) stays true to the spirit of the original by sticking to handheld cameras to document the infected&#146;s rampages. Like its predecessor, 28 WEEKS LATER beautifully illustrates that the monsters in our worst nightmares are no match for the casual destruction brought on by human foibles.

A spoiled, sheltered heiress (Colbert) flees her controlling father and hits the road. It isn't long before she needs the help of a down-on-his luck reporter played by the roguishly charming Clark Gable. They immediately drive each other completely crazy, trading barbs with a comedic chemistry that is rarely replicated. In fact, Colbert and Gable find each other so infuriating that they can't help but fall madly in love. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is a romantic, hilarious, Hollywood classic that is not to be missed.

synopsis: Ah, the Fifties, a time when a suburban starter home became the aspiration of millions&#133; but what if you could get that suburban home on wheels!?! At least that&#146;s the dream of one half of the newlyweds at the center of this classic comedy. And, when Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz play the married couple, we&#146;ll give you one guess which half wants the mobile home. Outrageous comedic set-pieces follow as the couple tries to simultaneously live the opposing dreams of the Fifties: the call of the open road and the bliss of domestic partnership.

The startling and unexpected conclusion is worth the price of admission alone.

Peter Bogdanovich&#146;s love of classic cinema is evident in every frame of this gorgeous, poignant black-and-white comedy and Ryan O&#146;Neal and real-life daughter Tatum turn in wonderfully charming performances as the oddball team of swindlers. The third of Bogdanovich&#146;s many collaborations with Kovacs, this remains a highpoint for both.

title: What's Up Doc?
synopsis: Peter Bogdanovich's hit screwball comedy pairs a free-spirited Barbara Streisand with an uptight, bespeckled Ryan O'Neal. A tense musicologist (O'Neal) travels to San Francisco in order to compete for a research grant. Unfortunately he has packed the same plaid suitcase as three other people and chaos immediately ensues as his igneous rocks are confused with government documents and jewels. In the tradition of Howard Hawk's Bringing Up Baby, Streisand is desperately smitten with O'Neal only to bring utterly hilarious havoc to his life. Not to be missed by any fans of screwball comedies.

synopsis: We&#146;ll warn you, this movie is ruthlessly un-PC. It&#146;s filled with bigoted, macho dialogue between its tough-as-nails cop protagonists&#133; It is also extremely funny and a great entry into the annals of slapstick action &#150; a peculiarly 70s genre. James Caan and Alan Arkin are Freebie and Bean, two San Francisco cops hot on the trail of the crime boss, &#147;Red&#148; Meyers and they will let no car remain uncrashed in their single-minded pursuit. Caan handles the comedic repartee with ease and Arkin is surprisingly good in a role that lets him be aggressive for once.

synopsis: As with many films of the period, SHAMPOO is a remarkable confluence of talent not only with the great Kovacs on camera but helmed by Hal Ashby (Harold &amp; Maude) and written by Robert Towne (Chinatown), not to mention Beatty in his legendary, hilarious performance as a frantic hairdresser/Cassanova juggling girlfriends and clients (and girlfriends&#146; husbands). Few other 70s films simultaneously capture the poignant death of 60s idealisim, the joy of excess and the anxiety and ennui that accompany both as well as SHAMPOO.

synopsis: Legendary cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs is largely credited (alongside friend and collaborator Vilmos Zsigmond) as having created the &#145;look&#146; of 70s film and nowhere is this more apparent than in the muted colors and sunset landscapes of EASY RIDER. Though this psychedelic motorcycle movie about two counterculture outsiders driving cross-country &#147;looking for America&#148; spawned countless imitators, nothing can compare to the image of lawyer George (Nicholson) riding on a motorcycle behind Captain America (Fonda) while wearing a football helmet. EASY RIDER, won Hopper &#145;Best New Director&#146; at Cannes and ushered in a new era in Hollywood cinema.

title: Close Encounters Of The Third Kind
synopsis: It is telling that Kovacs, who helped to create independent-minded studio films at the dawn of the 70s, was also involved in this film that helped to destroy it. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is a great film, there&#146;s no denying, but its blockbuster status (paired with the success of Jaws) renewed the studio heads faith in big budget spectacles at the expense of the more intimate character driven films that had been the lifeblood of prior 70s filmmaking. Kovacs partnered with his friend Vilmos Zsigmond on the photography for Spielberg&#146;s fascinating, beautiful film about the appearance of aliens in our midst &#150; not for invasion but for inter-species learning and betterment.
